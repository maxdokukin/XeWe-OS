NO AI USE ADDENDUM (v1.0)

for the Software. If there is any conflict between this Addendum and the Base License,
**this Addendum controls**.

1) Definitions
   "Software" means the software licensed by the Licensor under the Base License.
   "AI System" means any system that uses machine learning, deep learning, large language models,
   foundation models, or similar techniques to train, fine-tune, or generate outputs.
   "Train" includes pretraining, fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from feedback, or any other
   process that adjusts model parameters or evaluation artifacts using the Software or its outputs.

2) Prohibited AI Uses
   You may not:
   (a) use the Software, or any substantial portion of it, or any data or outputs generated by it,
       to train, fine-tune, evaluate, or improve any AI System;
   (b) incorporate the Software into any product or service whose primary purpose is providing
       AI or machine-learning functionality; or
   (c) create datasets or other materials derived from the Software or its outputs for the purpose
       of training, fine-tuning, evaluating, or improving any AI System.

3) Clarifications
   Incidental developer tooling (for example, IDE autocomplete, code search, static analysis, or
   formatting tools) does not by itself violate this Addendum, provided that the Software or its
   outputs are not used to train or fine-tune any AI System.

4) Commercial & AI Licenses
   Commercial or AI uses may be available under a separate written license from the Licensor.

5) Enforcement & Termination
   Any breach of this Addendum terminates your rights under the Base License and this Addendum.
   All disclaimers and limitations of liability in the Base License survive termination.

6) Redistribution
   You must include this Addendum alongside the Base License whenever you convey the Software.
