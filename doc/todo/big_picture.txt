before 2.0 release
need to polish up the user journey, text printing everywhere
the core is ready and works as well as it was designed

future vectors:
rethink the logic of the buttons. it was vibe coded and might have logical inefficiencies
rethink the logic of the serial port. it can have more useful methods for more compact in code printing
    there are some patterns (headers) that can be well generalized
for modules and interfaces, we need a way to ensure that there is a if(disabled) return before each method.
this can be a validation script that is a part of a compilation script
look into code styling
for the compilation logic and flow, create buiild folder for each build with the src copy and compiled file, put in
timestamps and build versions in the code and build folders; tracibility
look in the led logic. it was far reviewed and might be outdated/inefficient

web interface has the most features coming
    chaining lights together
    add s slider
    rm values
    add scheduling feature
    led num config support
    add presets

alexa, homekit are mature
    they might get individual devices for each color mode, which is the only way to put the mode logic through
